        <h1>The Wind In The Willows</h1>
        <p>The goal of this project was to re-design a public domain
            book, with our own take and art direction. The problem being
            solved was modernizing an old book to cater to new audiences
            with better developed design.
            The strategy used was first researching the book “Wind
            in the Willows” By Kenneth Grahame from 1908, and relative
            genres and similar. I then explored different typeface
            combinations for the title and body copy. I Then created a
            moodboard that encapsulates the direction I want to head,
            including the chose typefaces. The next important step was
            sketching different ideas and multiple possible scenes for
            the poster & cover. Finally of course, the designing phase
            and finishing touches.
            The take away from this assignment was how to properly
            build and design a book, keeping in mind the target audience
            of children. I had different experiences between both
            the cover where I had a lot of lee-way and creativity, and the
            inside whereas I had more bounds to work within and how
            I learned to adjust the type structure to fix H&J violations.</p>
