            <div>
                <p>The goal of this major studio project was to create a new product and service, focusing on designing a monthly yarn & pattern subscription box for yarn crafters to sign up and use.
                 The challenge was to self-direct and use all my learned graphic design and professional skills. The strategy that I used was to document my interests and note what can be useful, 
                 choosing a yarn craft packaging box and an inner mini-booklet. </p>

                <p>I gathered different inspiration images to create my moodboard, noting I wanted to keep the handmade doodle look. Having the doodles was very important, helping with the movement 
                and guiding the user's eye, while also keeping the fun factor. 
                I then started with doodling different cute assets that I could use, exploring the direction. To aid in designing my project's images and pattern, I crocheted the featured pillow! 
                I then also made a small mockup with lined paper and drew on it to show how everything connected.</p>
                
               <p>A takeaway of this project was understanding the 3D design of the packaging, especially with connecting the yarn doodles across each surface of the packaging. Another takeaway was 
                experimenting and connecting the typeface’s personality with Skeine’s doodles and brand direction. </p>

                    <h2>Sketches</h2>
                    <p>To get things started, I explored different layouts along with doodles based around spring. 
                        I knew I wanted yarn and flowers to be definite assets, so I mostly experimented with them.
                        I played around with the number of petals, the movement of the yarn, and the lineart brush style, 
                        whether to make it like a ball pen, or more of an angled marker. </p>

                    <h2>Creative Creation</h2> 
                    <p>The main typeface used for the headings is New Kansas Bold. The paragraph and caption typeface is Niramit regular and italics. 
                                            
                    I wanted spring colours, that are vibrant but soft. The main green lime was meant for being creative and connected to nature, as to thats where we acquire the yarn. 
                    The pink bubblegum was meant to express caring and playfulness, for the act of creating and gifting. 
                                            
                    Most of these doodles are seen in the deliverables, except the bottom right section, where it was used as inspiration for possible assets. 
                    I also tested the doodle colours as well, deciding if to make them pure black, off-black charcoal, or even white.
