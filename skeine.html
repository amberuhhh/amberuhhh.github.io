            <h1>Skeine</h1>
            <p>The goal of this major studio project was to create a new product and service, focusing on designing a monthly yarn & pattern subscription box for yarn crafters to sign up and use.
                The challenge was to self-direct and use all my learned graphic design and professional skills. The strategy that I used was to document my interests and note what can be useful, 
                choosing a yarn craft packaging box and an inner mini-booklet. </p>

            <p>A takeaway of this project was understanding the 3D design of the packaging, especially with connecting the yarn doodles across each surface of the packaging. Another takeaway was 
            experimenting and connecting the typeface’s personality with Skeine’s doodles and brand direction. </p>

                <h2>Sketches</h2>
                <p>To get things started, I explored different layouts along with doodles based around spring. 
                    I knew I wanted yarn and flowers to be definite assets, so I mostly experimented with them.
                    I played around with the number of petals, the movement of the yarn, and the lineart brush style, 
                    whether to make it like a ball pen, or more of an angled marker. </p>

                <h2>Creative Creation</h2> 
                <p>The main typeface used for the headings is New Kansas Bold. The paragraph and caption typeface is Niramit regular and italics. 
                                        
                I wanted spring colours, that are vibrant but soft. The main green lime was meant for being creative and connected to nature, as to thats where we acquire the yarn. 
                The pink bubblegum was meant to express caring and playfulness, for the act of creating and gifting. 
                                        
                Most of these doodles are seen in the deliverables, except the bottom right section, where it was used as inspiration for possible assets. 
                I also tested the doodle colours as well, deciding if to make them pure black, off-black charcoal, or even white.

                <h2>Featured Pillow</h2>
                <p>In order to enhance the project and acquire appropriate images, I decided to crochet the featured flower pillow! 
                    The process took about 2 days, balancing my time around other activities.            
                    I followed the exact pattern in the booklet, adjusting the pattern 
                    to save yarn as well as implementing better techniques that I learned through my previous projects.

                <h2>Rough Package Mockup</h2> 
                <p>This is a mini prototype mockup for the box packaging, cheap enough to print on a 11” x 17” paper.
                    And then the pattern booklet inside, that I accidentally printed it too large. 
                    It’s meant to be 5.8” x 8.2”, just enough to fit in the mailing box, which is 9” x 6” x 4”.

                <h1>Mailer Package</h1> 
                <p>Starting with the packaging, I knew I wanted a full single-coloured background to really stand out. 
                    I experimented with the way the yarn doodles moves around the box and 
                    how I wanted my little doodles to fit within them. 
                    It starts with flowers at the top then having the logo image on the center back,
                     and having just the yarn lines and hearts featured throughout. 
                    Then the outside, through feedback, having a band around the box would be cool,
                     along with a tearing security feature around the opening.
                    I thought having the doodles just on the band would work, and have the yarn 
                    lines go everywhere instead to not make it bland. 
                    Same thing goes with this light water-colour texture behind the skeine logo for added effect. 
                    Also, note how I have the perforated circles here for the user to push out 
                    in order to feed yarn through for easier unravelling and storage.

                <h1>Mini-Booklet</h1>
                <p>The second deliverable is the inner booklet, which explains Skeine’s mission, 
                    what’s included, and of course, the patterns, 
                    along with abbreviations and notes that help the user in their creation process. 

                    I enjoyed this part of the project more, as I had more area to experiment and be creative with.
                    I took inspiration from existing pattern books and online sources, 
                    though I wanted to stray away from being too cliche and tacky. 
                    
                    With a lot of freedom, I could do what I want to do, implementing how I understand reading things, 
                    and how I read or anticipate things to be placed and aligned.
