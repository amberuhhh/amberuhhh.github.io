        <h1>Comfort Coffee</h1>
        <p>The purpose of this project was to design a coffee company,
            its products packaging and finally build a campaign to release
            Comfort Coffee to the world. The challenge here is that
            no one knows that Comfort Coffee exists, so a final awareness
            campaign is chosen to boost sales, views and interaction.
            My approach to this project was to start researching other
            coffee companies, including their products and how they
            promote their service. I created a moodboard to get the vibes
            and art direction started, and started sketching different
            ideas for the main products. I wanted the design to be crafty,
            and to also show that its sustainable through minimal design.
            This project helped me learn how to design a brand and its
            products, but then also how to build a campaign to help grow
            the company. The main area I learned was how to layout a
            flatplan within illustrator to then be printed and assembled.</p>
